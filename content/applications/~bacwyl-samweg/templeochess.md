### Chess from Temple OS
![Screenshot](https://0x0.st/oORF.png)

Temple O Chess is a pixel-for-pixel reproduction of the chess game from Temple OS.

It was created using [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/Raej8C2yIEc) as a reference.

It's a fully playable online chess game. Instead of a challenge system, games are formed using a naive public queue.

Just queue up, and you will be automatically matched with the next (or previous) player.
