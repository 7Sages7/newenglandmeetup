### Portal is sovereign social media

Portal is an Urbit-native social media platform. It's a tool for discovery of apps, groups, and content on Urbit. In addition to being the global conversation hub of Urbit, it supports paid apps, app reviews, micropayments on Ethereum, and composability of %groups messages, %pals, and %radio channels.

Long term, the team aims to let users build and monetize their own feed algorithms using LLMs, creating an open marketplace of highly personalized and novel content experiences.
