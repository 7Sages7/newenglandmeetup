Apprenticeships are practical learning opportunities for new Urbit developers provided by experienced members of the Urbit development community. As an apprentice, you'll have the opportunity to:

- Learn from an experienced Urbit contributor
- Make helpful contributions to an active project, and
- Earn address space for learning

Becoming an apprentice is easily one of the best ways to level up your skills, and perhaps even land a job.

## Get started

Apprenticeships are for those that are new to Urbit development (or an area of it), and would like to find their grounding by working on a pre-existing codebase and problem set. Nearly all apprenticeships involve some degree of Hoon work, so you should make sure that you've completed [Hoon School](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/core/hoon-school) and [App School](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/core/app-school/intro) in either their asychronous or [cohort formats](https://developers.urbit.org/courses) prior to signing up.

There are two ways to sign up for an apprenticeship:

1. [Apply for an open apprenticeship](/grants?program=apprenticeship&open=true&wip=false&completed=false#view-grants)
2. [Sign up to be matched to a mentor](https://airtable.com/shrUZQpHqRtudHhAx)

Apprenticeships are sometimes posted on the site to be claimed, but more often than not they emerge out of a conversation between a mentor and an enthusiastic potential apprentice. This is because mentors are generally busy engineering, and while they know many things that need to be done, getting those ideas into writing is difficult.

When you [sign up to be matched](https://airtable.com/shrUZQpHqRtudHhAx), the Urbit Foundation will review your application, pass it around to available mentors, and more often than not a call will get scheduled with the lead for a project that may be a good fit.

## How it works

Once a mentor has written up an apprenticeship, and approved an apprentice, The Urbit Foundation will perform a quick KYC step and send contracts to all parties for signing. Once those contracts are executed, work can proceed.

The mentor will host a group with a chat and notebook where ongoing asychronous discussions can occur, and long-form content can be shared. 

Mentors and apprentices work together by having weekly pairing sessions and maintaining an open line of communication over Urbit. It's expected that mentors put at least two hours per week into supporting their apprentice.

## Funding

Apprenticeships pay 1 star upon the sucessful completion of the apprenticeship, for an apprenticeship of a duration of up to three months.

## Getting Paid

When an apprentice has completed the scope of their grant, they will create a detailed writeup of the work completed and their learnings, post it in the Apprenticeship notebook, and get the approval of their mentor. After recieving this approval from your mentor, please [submit an invoice here](https://airtable.com/shrXXCs1uaxtNSBcg). Upon successful review of this notebook post by the Urbit Foundation and an invoice recieved for the amount agreed upon in your grant or milestone, the Foundation will pay your star allocation to the Ethereum address you have provided.

We approve and issue payments within 30 days of invoice receipt and approval, although often payment is made more quickly as transactions are batched with other grantees who have recently completed milestones. If you are having any issues accepting stars through [Bridge](https://bridge.urbit.org) please contact `~taller-ravnut` for assistance.
