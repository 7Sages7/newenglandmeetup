Imagine how easy it would be to write and deploy software in a world where every user had their own server, networking protocols were simple and universal, and the primitives weren’t destined to a never ending spiral of breaking changes. So much of the path dependency that has made writing software today a matter of hacking at an ugly morass of load-bearing arcana could be wiped away, and you could focus on clean business logic and seamless UX.

Now stop imagining, because we’ve already built it. 

Like anything else, the best way to go about learning how to build on Urbit is to forge your own path. [Get on the network](https://airtable.com/shrmfUVpMskWw145u), clicking around this website. If you attended a Campus Outreach event and remember a term you didn’t understand, go to the search bar in the top right and see what comes up. 

Here are a few links to help get you started:

—

### [Urbit Developers Overview](https://developers.urbit.org/)
An overview of using Urbit for development

### [Lightning Tutorials](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/quickstart/intro)
Get a feel for the process of making and deploying an Urbit app in half an hour, no previous experience required

### [Core Curriculum](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/core)
Learn the Urbit stack at your own pace

The Foundation also regularly runs a series of cohort-based live courses that go over the core curriculum, free and open to all. One lesson per week for ~8 weeks that can easily be worked into even the busiest schedules. You can also get help with the Urbit stack on the network at the New Hooniverse group on Urbit.

### [Live Courses](https://developers.urbit.org/courses)
Learn the Urbit stack as part of a group

### [New Hooniverse](https://urbit.org/groups/~hiddev-dannut/new-hooniverse)
Discussion group for learning the Urbit stack. Open to beginner, intermediate, and advanced developers

Fledgling developers may also be interested in a new framework from [Holium](https://www.holium.com/) that allows Urbit apps to be built entirely in Javascript, as well as the Foundation’s grants program that provides opportunities for junior devs to tackle challenges at their level and take ownership of some of the Urbit address space.

A framework for building Urbit apps solely with Javascript

### [Grants]("/grants")
Build on Urbit and take ownership of the network in the process
