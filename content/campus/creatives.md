Look, this thing is being built in flight. Most of the low-hanging fruit is still there, waiting to be picked by those with the technical chops to do so. Opportunities outside that are limited.

Still, even in its relatively nascent state, it is already exceedingly obvious that Urbit will become the premier places for communities to organize on their own terms. There are already publishing tools that allow individuals to wholly replace monopolistic platforms, chief among them being Studio from Tirrel.
