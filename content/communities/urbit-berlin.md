If you are sick of the current state of the web, of handing over your data and entire online presence to a handful of American corporations, of a web fueled with ads, then Urbit might be for you.

Are you curious about Urbit and want to try it? Are you an Urbit OG looking to find to find others? Do you want to build your own peer-to-peer apps and leave the centralized web behind?

We meet regularly in Berlin, and we try to have a theme or presentation for each meetup.
