Alphabet is a company that builds a peer-to-peer prediction market on Urbit. It leverages the networkâ€™s decentralized structure and built-in reputation system for fundamental breakthroughs in the design of a betting platform. Because Alphabet is on Urbit, users can make uncensorable, pseudonymous bets against other users.
