Red Horizon is designed by Chorus One. They work to expand the freedom and sovereignty that human beings experience in their digital lives.

Decentralized blockchain networks have brought to light the need for people to own personal servers that respect their data, communications, and identity ownership.

Red Horizon handles the technical part of securely running your Urbit, so that you can do the fun part.
