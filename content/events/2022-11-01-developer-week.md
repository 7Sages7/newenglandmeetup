It's been almost two months since our second Assembly, and the last cohort of Hoon School Live has just finished. 2022 is drawing to a close and the Urbit developer community is getting bigger every day. This calls for a celebration. 

From the 14th until the 18th of November the Urbit Foundation is organizing Urbit Developer Week. A week full of announcements, good conversations, the launch of several new initiatives and much more. 

Check back here or keep an eye on our socials and the network.  A full schedule of events will be available soon.
