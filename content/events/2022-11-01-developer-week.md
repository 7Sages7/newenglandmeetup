2022 is slowly coming to an end, Assembly is almost 2 months ago and the last cohort of Hoon School Live has just finished. The Urbit developer community is getting bigger every day and that calls for a celebration. 

From the 14th until the 18th of November the Urbit Foundation is organizing Urbit Developer Week. A week full of announcements, good conversations, the launch of several new initiatives and much more. 

Stay tuned here or on the network, we will release the full schedule soon.
