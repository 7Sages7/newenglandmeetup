Urbit Foundation is excited to announce the **2024 Urbit Developer Summit!** This year’s Summit is being held in the _Deep South_ at a beautiful venue on Lake Lanier just 1 hour's drive from Atlanta International Airport. A sprawling lakeside retreat centre will become our Urbit compound for 4 days, and we’ll have access to a pool, hot tub, volleyball court, jet skis, fire pit, and a boat. **Lake Summit** is aimed at Urbit Developers, and will be an opportunity to share what we've all been working on, hack together IRL, and just hang out. Whether you are a freshly-minted Hoon Academy grad, a seasoned grantee, or an Urbit-curious Earth-software dev, we invite you to this key event of the Urbit ecosystem’s calendar — held this year in the swampy lakelands of Georgia.

## The Details

Lake Summit will take place from **Monday 17 - Friday 21 June.** Opening evening will start from 4pm Monday. Summit will end with a closing party Thursday night.

**Tickets cost $400.** Financial support scholarships are available.

If you are interested in joining us at Lake Summit, we encourage you to submit an application using the [form](https://forms.gle/Kr2Fg5YUBdNPK5DT8)

## Travel

You will need to organise your own travel between Lake Lanier and Atlanta airport (an Uber should cost around $120). You will also need to arrange for travel between your accommodation and the venue each day. We recommend using Uber or a rental car. There is ample parking space at the venue. 

## Hope to see you there!
