### 1. Get oriented

After you've logged into your Urbit for the first time, you're officially an Urbiter! You've unlocked the entire Urbit network with your newly-minted ID — the key to your new digital life.

You'll see your Home and a few pre-installed applications: Terminal, Groups, and Bitcoin. More on them in a moment.

Above those are buttons to view System Preferences and Help and Support and check out notifications for newly-installed or recently-updated applications, respectively. The search bar helps you surface applications you already have installed, or discover developers and applications across the Urbit network.

You'll likely want to focus on finding and joining new communities, which you can do with the **Groups** app. Click on the box to open the application.

### 2. Join a few groups with fellow Urbiters

No two people will ever have the same experience on Urbit. That depends entirely on who you find and where they invite you to join them. But we can set you down a good path.

With Groups open, you'll see three boxes for **My Channels**, your local weather, and a stylized clock. You can dig into those later, but let's focus on joining new communities, which is likely one of the reasons you wanted to try out Urbit in the first place.

Click on Join Group, and in that modal, enter [~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community](/groups/~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community) — the official Urbit community. You can either automatically join all channels by clicking the Join all channels checkbox, or leave it blank and hit Join Group right away. Your Urbit will connect to the P2P network and download information about the group, like a list of all its participants. When that's finished, click **View Group**.

You're now looking at a single group and all of its channels. If you didn't choose to join all channels right away, click on an individual channel and then **Join Channel**, which immediately opens the feed of latest messages.

Here are a few more useful groups to join:

- [`~rondev/group-discovery`](/groups/~rondev/group-discovery): A group for finding other groups.
- [`~middev/the-forge`](/groups/~middev/the-forge): A group for sharing, discussing, and discovering new Urbit applications.
- [`~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon`](/groups/~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon): A community around [Uqbar](https://uqbar.network), a company creating applications and experiences on top of Urbit — notably EScape, which is an alternative to the default Groups application for joining communities and messaging with other Urbiters.

### 3. Get more Urbit apps

Groups are great, but Urbit goes way deeper with apps that are developed specifically for Urbit and use P2P networking for everything.

We'll use [Canvas](/applications/~dister-norsyr-torryn/canvas) — a collaborative app for creating pixel art with others — as an example to show the process.

Head back to your Urbit's home — the URL you used to log in and view your preinstalled apps. From there, click on the search bar and enter `~dister-norsyr-torryn/canvas`. Click on the first result, which shows you details about the developer, the license, a website for more information, and when the app was last updated.

Click **Get App**, then **Get "Canvas"** to continue. Your Urbit gets to work, and once installation is finished, click Open App to see it in action.

Some popular apps to get things moving:

- [EScape](/applications/~dister-fabnev-hinmur/escape): An alternative UI to the core groups, communities, and messaging capabilities in Urbit.
- [Studio](/applications/~tirrel/studio): Tools for making money on the Urbit network.
- [Wrdu](/applications/~magped-magped-rabsef-bicrym/wrdu): A Wordle clone.

### 4. Get help

If you need help getting around Urbit, the best place to go is the official Urbit community: [`~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community`](/groups/~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community). Those in the Help channel are willing to troubleshoot or provide links to resources to help you get out of a jam.

That community isn't for every support request, however. If your question involves an app, you're better served reaching out to the developer — for example, if you have an issue with EScape's notifications feature, reach out to Uqbar in [`~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon`](/groups/~hocwyn-tipwex/uqbar-event-horizon).

If you're having trouble with your planet or the hosting provider that's running your ship, try their support, as they'll have more context and resources to help solve your issue.

And if you can't get through this guide and launch into Urbit, you may have luck with the [Urbit Live community](https://t.me/UrbitLiveGroup) on Telegram.

### 5. What's next?

You made it! You did the work and now have your Final Computer.

What you do with it is up to you. Where you go from here is up to you. No two experiences on Urbit will be the same, so we encourage you to follow your own. Explore. Discover! Get lost and find the people who make you feel like you're not lost any more.
