- Hosting providers are companies that offer "Urbit as a Service"
  - Generally bundle ID with hosting, making it turnkey
  - Some offer BYOID
- Tradeoffs: turnkey, customer service to take care of things, ownership is
  contingent on third party
- Exit: assuming good actors, you can go from hosting service to self-hosted and
  vice versa, unlike with, e.g. Twitter
