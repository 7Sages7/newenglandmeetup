Hosting providers are companies that offer "Urbit as a Service".  They do the work of setting up your urbit in the cloud and making sure it's up to date and you don't have perform any technical steps or maintenance.

Generally, you'll get an Urbit ID by signing up with a hosting provider, but some allow you to bring your own Urbit ID, or even your pier (all your urbit data.)

While hosting providers offer convenience and customer support, hosting does mean trusting your provider with your data, just as you would any MEGACORP internet service company. However, unlike with MEGACORP, you'll always be able to exit with your Urbit ID to another provider or self-hosting.  And your hosting provider has every reason to be as helpful as possible to you in this process.

The two important points one should remember about hosting providers:

- Because the provider has access to the resources that run your Urbit experience, you must trust them with your data.

- Urbit has portable data, so you should be able to work with a hosting provider to download all your data and boot up elsewhere if you choose to migrate or start self-hosting.
