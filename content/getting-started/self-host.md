TODO

- Brief bit about technical architecture, since audience is technical
- To start, read about the different types of ID
- Choose where to run Urbit.
- On your local computer is good for experimentation, but not long-term usage
  because you want it to run as a server. 
- Can start local and move to a cloud hosting or home server, or start with
  either of the latter options
- Tradeoff: ownership over data and ID, ongoing maintenance costs

NOTES

To run Urbit on your own you need to be comfortable using a command line
interface (CLI), and should have a basic understanding of how to interact with
the Ethereum blockchain.

Urbit OS is comprised of a virtual operating system (Arvo) and a runtime called
(Vere). The runtime has official versions targeting Linux and macOS, although
workarounds exist for Windows.
