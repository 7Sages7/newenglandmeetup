There are a lot of ways this project could shake out.

- The gold standard would basically be run-your-own-ProtonMail from Urbit.
- One could also build a CLI email agent, like Mutt.  This would be a good start.
- The minimum viable product would be a front-end on Mars for a connected email server process on Earth.

Anything in between would also be acceptable.  There are some interesting crossovers possible as well, such as sending email to `@p`.
