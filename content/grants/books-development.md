[Books](https://urbit.org/grants/books) is an application for managing your crypto wallets, transactions, and counterparties. It allows you to add your wallet and other peopleâ€™s, track balances and transactions, and add private annotations to all of the above.


## Overview

Books was developed by Quartus and has is currently distributed from [~dister-dozzod-dalten](web+urbitgraph://~dister-dozzod-dalten/books). The Foundation has found internal use for Books and has decided to fund continued development for some key features.

### Features in scope

- Rolodex entries should support multiple public addresses.
- Transactions in the ledger should automatically be associated with known counterparties from the rolodex. The associations should happen even for transactions that happened before the rolodex entry was created.
- Books should recognize transactions involving Urbit stars.
- Books should be able to display balances.
- Books should issue notifications on incoming transactions.
