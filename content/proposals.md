## Proposals

If you've got an idea to build on or improve Urbit, the Urbit Foundation can fund you to make it real. We fund all sorts of projects: core system work, apps, integrations with other technologies, developer libraries and documentation, community formation, written and video content, and more. 

Send us your proposal, and we'll let you know. We can either accept it or give you useful feedback.

## Bounties

The Urbit Foundation and other ecosystem organizations post work opportunities as bounties. If you're looking for work and want inspiration, [browse through our postings here](/grants?program=bounty&open=true&wip=false&completed=false#view-grants).

Some bounties are fully specified contracts, including milestones and rewards. For these, simply agree to the contract, fulfill the requirements, and receive your payout.

Other bounties are less specified, pointing at a general idea that we'd like to see come to life. These bounties also usually have unspecified rewards, because we don't know how much work is involved. We invite you to submit your specs for these bounties, including milestones and rewards. If such a bounty interests you and you'd like help drafting a grant, reach out to us.

## Getting Help

If you need help writing a grant application, we are available for you. Please reach out via email to grants@urbit.org, DM ~tamlut-modnys on the network, or stop by the Grants Office Hours which are held Thursdays at 1pm Eastern Time in the [Urbit Hacker House](https://app.gather.town/app/xAYeiPI2XDYhRM9t/urbit-hacker-house). 


## The Grants Process

### Submit your Application

Using the [grant application link](https://airtable.com/apppnWSqfsVvUwkWh/shrCi54rEDxgSZr3z), write your proposal. If you're applying for a pre-written bounty, simply copy over the details from the listing. In the application, provide some background about yourself so we can know you're the right candidate.

Each grant has a **champion**, an experienced community member who will help you, keep track of the grant, and be your point of contact. If you have a choice of champion in mind, please mention that in the application. Bounties often have champions already listed. Otherwise, the Urbit Foundation will assign you a champion.

### Get Approved by the Foundation

After applying, the Urbit Foundation will review your application. In some cases, we may schedule a quick follow-up interview. 

Some bounties are sponsored by other organizations and may include compensation from them. In these cases, the grantee should discuss the details with them.

### Sign a Contract

If your application is accepted, you will undergo a quick KYC process and recieve a contract for signature. 

### Work and Get Paid

After you've finished your work on a given milestone, you can receive a payout. To do so, contact your champion and demonstrate to them that you've completed the work. After they verify your work and send their approval to the Foundation, you can [submit an invoice](https://airtable.com/shrXXCs1uaxtNSBcg). 

Once we receive both approval and an invoice for a milestone, we will pay your reward to the ETH address you provided.

## Frequently Asked Questions

{% faqSection question="Where can I talk to people about grants?" %}
As mentioned in the [Getting Help](#getting-help) section, you should reach out to grants@urbit.org or stop by the Office Hours at 1pm Eastern Time every Thursday in the [Urbit Hacker House](https://app.gather.town/app/xAYeiPI2XDYhRM9t/urbit-hacker-house). 

In addition, there are several Urbit groups where you can chat with the community about your questions, such as the **Hooniverse** (~hiddev-dannut/new-hooniverse) for coding-related questions, **[battery payload]** (~dister-dozzod-lapdeg/battery-payload) for general dev questions, and **UF Public**(~halbex-palheb/uf-public) for general questions.
{% /faqSection %}


{% faqSection question="How do I write a proposal?" %}
Proposals should clearly articulate your idea and the value it
will bring to the Urbit network.

Good proposals include the following:

— A detailed and clear description of the project. If you're
proposing something technical, user stories can help explain what
your creation will enable.

— An overview of why you are the right person for the job. A
description of your background, familiarity with the project, and
professional/education experience are all great.

— Your estimate for date(s) of completion.

— The amount of funding you'd like for the project, denominated in
stars.

Unless your project is small, you should write it as several milestones,
each of which has its own completion dates, funding amounts and
deliverables. Each completed milestone can receive a payout.

Proposals should target a first
milestone within two months of the start of the project.
Proposals should have a maximum of five milestones, and each milestone
should constitute significant enough work to warrant at
least a full star.

For writing guidance, you can [look at past completed proposals here](/grants?type=Proposal&status=completed#view-grants)

{% /faqSection %}


{% faqSection question="What are grants funded with?" %}

Grants are usually funded with [stars](https://docs.urbit.org/glossary/star), which are immutable and scarce pieces of the Urbit network. 65,280 possible stars exist in the network, and they sit between the 256 galaxies which govern the network and the 4 billion planets which serve as user level identities. Stars have short, distinctive names like ~marzod or ~sonnet. Each star contains 65,536 planets of their own.

Sometimes grants may be funded with other assets on a case-by-case basis.

{% /faqSection %}


{% faqSection question="How much funding should I request?" %}

We determine how much to value a particular grant by weighing how much work the project takes, the value to the Urbit universe, and the track record of the contributor (either past Urbit ecosystem work or relevant external background).

One possible metric is to come up with an estimate for numbers of hours of work you'll do, an estimate for how much your time is worth per hour, multiply those together, and then divide it by current star prices to receive a rough estimate for number of stars (check Opensea for latest Urbit star sales if you’re unsure). 

If you have a large grant that would request over 5 stars, the Foundation usually prefers to fund it in smaller grants of less than 5 stars each.

Send in your proposal with a best estimate of what you think it’s worth, and we will get back to you with an approval or a request for adjustment.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="Do grants have a timeline?" %}
Yes, every grant should have clear estimates for completion of milestones and the full project.

Any milestone that is more than a month behind your estimate should be communicated to your champion. We are happy to adjust timelines due to reasonable circumstances, so long as the contributor is communicative.

Grants that fall far behind timelines may be considered abandoned and subject to cancellation.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="Can I modify an already approved grant?" %}
Modifications to the scope of a grant that's already approved, such as adding features and compensation, or removing them, are generally possible. We know that plans can often change due to learning new things while working on a project.

Reach out to your champion or grants@urbit.org to discuss modifications.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="Can grants be cancelled?" %}
Grant contracts may be terminated by either the Foundation or the grantee given 7 days notice. If you’ve changed your mind about a grant, please communicate that to grants@urbit.org. 
{% /faqSection %}


{% faqSection question="When will I hear back about my grant application?" %}
The grants team meets to look at grants on Tuesday every two weeks. After these meetings, they will inform you whether it is approved, rejected or needs some adjustments. In the latter case someone on the grants team will help you finetune your proposal so it can be reconsidered in the next round.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="What does a grant champion do?" %}
A champion is an Urbit community member who will be your point of contact for the grant. They will provide support, answer questions, and make sure that your grant is on track.

If you have an idea for someone that can champion your grant, then mention it in your writeup. Bounties usually have a champion already listed. Otherwise, the Foundation is happy to assign someone to you.

Here are some guidelines for how to engage with your champion:
  - Meet regularly: Many grantees find it helpful to set up a regular check-in, either once a week or every other week. Don't hesitate to reach out to your champion with questions.

  - Ask for connections: Champions are well-connected throughout the network and know who's who. If you need support in a particular area that is beyond your champion's expertise, they should be able to put you in touch with someone that can help. You can also leverage the Urbit community by asking in groups like the Hooniverse (~hiddev-dannut/new-hooniverse) and [battery payload] (~dister-dozzod-lapdeg/battery-payload).

  - Get your work reviewed: Part of your champion's job is to review your work, so let them know when you need something reviewed. 

If for any reason, there are communication issues with your champion, reach out to grants@urbit.org and we can assist.
{% /faqSection %}


{% faqSection question="What paperwork will I need to fill out?" %}
After your proposal is approved, it will be added to this website, and the Urbit Foundation will need to get a signed contributor agreement and collect a small amount of personal information from you as part of our KYC (Know Your Customer) process.

The Urbit Foundation must comply with international law when distributing address space. We try to keep this process as minimal as we can, but there's no way to avoid it entirely without legally jeopardizing the Foundation's operations.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="How does the payment process work?" %}
After you've finished your work on a milestone, you should get signoff from your champion. To do this, you'll contact them and demonstrate that you’ve fulfilled the details of the milestone. This is often best done by setting up a call and doing a live demonstration. In any case, you should send them relevant instructions, github repos, or app download links.

Once they’ve approved, you can [submit an invoice](https://airtable.com/shrXXCs1uaxtNSBcg). When the Urbit Foundation receives approval from your champion and an invoice for the amount agreed upon in your grant or milestone, the Foundation will pay your star allocation to the Ethereum address you have provided.

We approve and issue payments within 30 days of invoice receipt and approval, although often payment is made more quickly. If you have any questions regarding getting paid or submitting an invoice, please contact accounting at accounting@urbit.org, or our grants team at grants@urbit.org.
