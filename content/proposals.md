## Proposals

If you've got an idea to build on or improve Urbit, the Urbit Foundation can fund you with network address space to make it real. We fund many different types of projects: core system work, apps, integrations with other technologies, developer libraries and documentation, community formation, written and video content, and more. 

Send us your proposal, and we'll let you know. It can either get accepted, or we can give you useful feedback.

## Bounties

The Urbit Foundation and other ecosystem organizations post work opportunities as bounties. If you're looking for Urbit-related work but want inspiration, [browse through our postings here](/grants?program=bounty&open=true&wip=false&completed=false#view-grants).

Some bounties are fully specified contracts, including milestones and rewards. For these, simply agree to the contract, fulfill the requirements, and receive your payout.

Other bounties are less specified, pointing at a general idea that we'd like to see come to life. These bounties also usually have unspecified rewards, because we don't know how much work is involved. We invite you to submit your specs for these bounties, including milestones and rewards. If such a bounty interests you and you'd like help drafting a grant, reach out to us.

## Getting Help

If you need help writing a grant application, we are available for you. Please reach out via email to grants@urbit.org, DM ~tamlut-modnys on the network, or stop by the Grants Office Hours which are held Thursdays at 1pm Eastern Time in the [Urbit Hacker House](https://app.gather.town/app/xAYeiPI2XDYhRM9t/urbit-hacker-house). 


## The Grants Process

### Submit your Application

Using the [grant application link](https://airtable.com/apppnWSqfsVvUwkWh/shrCi54rEDxgSZr3z), write your proposal. If you're applying for a pre-specified bounty, simply copy over the details from the listing. In the application, provide some background about yourself so we can know you're the right candidate.

Each grant has a **champion**, an experienced community member who will help you, keep track of the grant, and be your point of contact. If you have a choice of champion in mind, please mention that in the application. Bounties often have champions already listed. Otherwise, the Urbit Foundation will assign you a champion.

### Get Approved by the Foundation

After applying, the Urbit Foundation will review your application. In some cases, we may schedule a quick follow-up interview. 

Some bounties are sponsored by other organizations and may include compensation from them. In these cases, the grantee should discuss the details with them.

### Sign a Contract

If your application is accepted, you will undergo a quick KYC process and recieve a contract for signature. 

### Work and Get Paid

After you've finished your work on a given milestone, you can receive a payout. To do so, contact your champion and demonstrate to them that you've completed the work. After they verify your work and send their approval to the Foundation, you can [submit an invoice](https://airtable.com/shrXXCs1uaxtNSBcg). 

Once the Urbit Foundation receives approval from your champion and an invoice for the amount specified in your milestone, the Foundation will pay your reward to the ETH address you provided.

## Frequently Asked Questions

{% faqSection question="Where can I talk to people about grants?" %}
As mentioned in the [Getting Help](#getting-help) section, you should reach out to grants@urbit.org or stop by the Office Hours at 1pm Eastern Time every Thursday in the [Urbit Hacker House](https://app.gather.town/app/xAYeiPI2XDYhRM9t/urbit-hacker-house). 

In addition, there are several Urbit groups where you can chat with the community about your questions, such as the Hooniverse (~hiddev-dannut/new-hooniverse) for coding-related questions, [battery payload] (~dister-dozzod-lapdeg/battery-payload) for general dev questions, and the Urbit Foundation group (~halbex-palheb/uf-public) for general questions.

{% faqSection question="How do I write a proposal?" %}
Proposals should clearly articulate your idea and the value it
will bring to the Urbit network.

Good proposals all include the following:

— A detailed and clear description of the project. If you're
proposing something technical, user stories can help explain what
your creation will enable.

— An overview of why you are the right person for the job. A
description of your background, familiarity with the project, and
professional/education experience are all great.

— Your estimate for date(s) of completion.

— The amount of funding you'd like for the project, denominated in
stars.

Unless your project is small, you should write it as several milestones,
each of which has its own completion dates, funding amounts and
deliverables. Each completed milestone can receive a payout.

Proposals should target a first
deliverable within two months of the start of the project.
Proposals should have a maximum of five milestones, and each milestone
should constitute significant enough work to warrant at
least a full star.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="Can I see past proposals as a reference for writing my own?" %}
[Yes, see past completed proposals here](/grants?type=Proposal&status=completed#view-grants)
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="How much funding should I request?" %}

Our formula for determining how much to value a particular grant is a function of how much work the project takes, value to the Urbit universe, and track record of the contributor (either via past work within the grants program, or a relevant external background).

One possible metric is to come up with an estimate for numbers of hours of work you'll do, an estimate for how much your time is worth per hour, multiply those together, and then divide it by current star prices to receive a rough estimate for number of stars (check Opensea for latest Urbit star sales if you’re unsure). 

If you have a large grant that would request over 5 stars, the Foundation usually prefers to fund it in smaller grants of less than 5 stars each.

Send in your proposal with a best estimate of what you think it’s worth, and we will get back to you with an approval or a request for adjustment.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="Should grants have a timeline?" %}
Yes, every grant should have clear estimates for completion of the milestones and the full project.

Any milestone that is more than a month behind your provided estimate should be communicated to your champion. We are happy to adjust timelines due to reasonable circumstances, so long as the contributor is communicative.

Grants that fall far behind timelines may be considered abandoned and subject to cancellation.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="Can grants be cancelled?" %}
Grant contracts may be terminated by either the Foundation or the grantee given 7 days notice. If you’ve changed your mind about a grant, please communicate that to grants@urbit.org. 
{% /faqSection %}


{% faqSection question="Can I modify an already approved grant?" %}
Modifications to the scope of a grant that's already approved, such as adding features and compensation, or removing them, are generally possible. We know that plans can often change due to what you learn while working on a project.

Reach out to your champion or grants@urbit.org to discuss modifications.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="When will I hear back about my grant?" %}
The Grants team of the Urbit Foundation looks at Grants on Tuesday every two weeks. After these meetings, they will inform you whether it is approved, rejected or needs some adjustments. In the latter case someone on the grants team will help you finetune your proposal so it can be reconsidered in the next round.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="What does a grant champion do?" %}
A champion is someone in the community who is interested in the success of your grant and can provide you support. They should be a point of contact who you can check in with and will make sure your milestones are being completed.

If you have an idea for someone that can champion your grant, then mention it in your writeup. Bounties usually have a champion already listed. Otherwise, the Foundation is happy to assign someone to you.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="How should I work with my champion?" %}
Here are some guidelines for how to engage with your champion:
  - Meet regularly: Those that can champion projects are chosen for their past contributions. This means that they're able to provide hands-on support. This structure works best if you set up a regular check-in, either once a week or every other week. If nothing else, having an accountability buddy is really helpful.

  - Stay in touch: Leverage the Urbit network for keeping in touch about your project. Don't hesitate to ask questions! The [battery payload]group (~dister-dozzod-lapdeg/battery-payload) is a great place to hang out with other developers, ask questions, and share your experiences.

  - Ask for connections: Champions are well-connected throughout the network and know who's who. If you need support in a particular area that is beyond your Champion's expertise, they should be able to put you in touch with someone that can help.

  - Get your work reviewed: Part of your Champion's job is to review your work and get others' eyes on it as well. Let them know when you need something reviewed. Particularly, this is required for getting review and signoff that you have completed a milestone, but can be helpful for other complex asks as well.

If for any reason, your champion is not providing the help you need, reach out to grants@urbit.org and we can assist.
{% /faqSection %}


{% faqSection question="What paperwork will I need to fill out?" %}
After your proposal is approved, it will be added to this website, and the Urbit Foundation will need to get a signed contributor agreement and collect a small amount of personal information from you as part of our KYC process.

The Urbit Foundation must comply with international law when distributing address space. We try to keep this process as minimal as we can, but there's no way to avoid it entirely without legally jeopardizing the Foundation's operations.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="How will I be paid?" %}
After you've finished your work on a milestone, you should get signoff from your champion. To do this, you'll contact them and demonstrate that you’ve fulfilled the details of the milestone. This is often best done by setting up a call and doing a live demonstration. In any case, you should send them relevant instructions, github repos, or app download links.

Once they’ve approved, you can [submit an invoice](https://airtable.com/shrXXCs1uaxtNSBcg). When the Urbit Foundation receives approval from your champion and an invoice for the amount agreed upon in your grant or milestone, the Foundation will pay your star allocation to the Ethereum address you have provided.
{% /faqSection %}

{% faqSection question="How long does payment take?" %}
We approve and issue payments within 30 days of invoice receipt and approval, although often payment is made more quickly. If you have any questions regarding getting paid or submitting an invoice, please contact accounting at accounting@urbit.org, or our grants team at grants@urbit.org.
