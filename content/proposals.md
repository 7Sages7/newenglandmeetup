## Proposals

If you've got an idea to build on or improve Urbit, the Urbit Foundation can fund you with network address space to make it real. We fund many different types of projects: core system work, apps, integrations with other technologies, developer libraries and documentation, community formation, written and video content, and more. 

Send us your proposal, and we'll let you know. It can either get accepted, or we can give you useful feedback.

## Bounties

The Urbit Foundation and other ecosystem organizations post work opportunities as bounties. If you're looking for Urbit-related work but want inspiration, [browse through our postings here](/grants?program=bounty&open=true&wip=false&completed=false#view-grants).

Some bounties are fully specified contracts, including milestones and rewards. For these, simply agree to the contract, fulfill the requirements, and receive your payout.

Other bounties are less specified, pointing at a general idea that we'd like to see come to life. These bounties also usually have unspecified rewards, because we don't know how much work is involved. We invite you to submit your specs for these bounties, including milestones and rewards. If such a bounty interests you and you'd like help drafting a grant, reach out to us.

## Help with Grants

If you need help writing a grant application, we are available for you. Please reach out via email to grants@urbit.org, DM ~tamlut-modnys on the network, or stop by the Grants Office Hours which are held Thursdays at 1pm Eastern Time in the [Urbit Hacker House](https://app.gather.town/app/xAYeiPI2XDYhRM9t/urbit-hacker-house). 

## The Grants Process

### Submit your Application

Using the [grant application link](https://airtable.com/apppnWSqfsVvUwkWh/shrCi54rEDxgSZr3z), write your proposal. If you're applying for a pre-specified bounty, simply copy over the details from the listing. In the application, provide some background about yourself so we can know you're the right candidate.

Each grant has a **champion**, an experienced community member who will help you, keep track of the grant, and be your point of contact. If you have a choice of champion in mind, please mention that in the application. Bounties often have champions already listed. Otherwise, the Urbit Foundation will assign you a champion.

### Get Approved by the Foundation

After applying, the Urbit Foundation will review your application. In some cases, we may schedule a quick follow-up interview. 

Some bounties are sponsored by other organizations and may include compensation from them. In these cases, the grantee should discuss the details with them.

### Sign a Contract

If your application is accepted, you will undergo a quick KYC process and recieve a contract for signature. 

### Work and Get Paid

After you've finished your work on a given milestone, you can receive a payout. To do so, contact your champion with the details of the milestone completed, any relevant instructions, github repos, or app download links. After they verify your work and send their approval to the Foundation, you can [submit an invoice](https://airtable.com/shrXXCs1uaxtNSBcg). 

Once the Urbit Foundation receives approval from your champion and an invoice for the amount specified in your milestone, the Foundation will pay your reward to the ETH address you provided.
